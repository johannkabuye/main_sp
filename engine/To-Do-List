To-Do: 

Tasks: 


Projects: 
-Editor patch (offline) (where samples can be loaded -through the browser- edited and sliced. 
-Editor patch - online - in the hardware integrated. 
-Redesign folder structure. Simple is better. 
-Design display patch. 
-Should I integrate a recorder?
-Remove compressor - creates incompatibility with different computer systems. 
--> in the end there will be a desktop and a RPI-Version (the RPI-Version will have special tools - compressor - synth - ect...)




Ideas: 
-Total rebuild - the instruments is for more modulised. Also, taking the idea from the octatrack, the sampler is now an 8 voice sampler where each voice gets controlled individualy. 

-Divide SP into: Livemode / Production mode. In Production mode heavy effects, poly synth can be loaded. In live mode: Sampler, monosynth + fixed FX.
- Different method to play 

Done: 
-Buscompressor/Limiter on Master-Out (01.09.2019)
-needs clipping protection for recording organelle into sampler (27.05.19)
-FX works for ein sample at a time. So far three fxs: filter, delay, pitch-shifter (26.05.19)
-make the project playable from the interface again. 
    -software keys should work.(26.05.19)
-load synth-patches from keys. (22.05.19)
-Nanokeys now plays the samples. Better feeling for playing - more buttons. But: now light indicated which pad is playing. (20.05.19)
-8-voice-polyphonie of 32 samples (15-19.05.19)
-Trigger-no loop mode needs a retrigger when hitting the sample-pad again. needs fix. (15.05.19)
-Marker2 shouldnt go beyong begining or end of sample. needs fix. (15.05.19)
-Current pad led is on. (14.05.19)
-Clicking at the end of the sample. Needs fix. (13.05.19)
  - Fade out at the end of recording. 
  - extra counter that fades the sample before it ends.
-remove that even note-off triggers current pattern status.(12.05.19)
-Fix Recording for Gate+Loop, Trigger+noloop, Trigger+loop.(12.05.19)
-Redesigning the input of the sampler-edit-voice(12.05.19)
